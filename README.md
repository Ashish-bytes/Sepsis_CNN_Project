# 🩺 CNN-Based Early Sepsis Detection from Medical Images

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to perform **early detection of sepsis** using medical images (such as X-rays, CT scans, or clinical imaging).  
The goal is to support healthcare workers by providing **automated early-stage diagnosis**, potentially reducing hospitalization time and improving patient outcomes.
